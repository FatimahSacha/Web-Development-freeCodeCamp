# Web-Development-freeCodeCamp
This Repo will be about my progress in learning front end development technologies such as HTML, CSS JavaScript etc with freeCodeCamp. 

Based on what I have learnt I will create my own mini projects starting off with the basics and then building upon it whilst I go through the <strong>Responsive Design Web Course</strong> by FreeCodeCamp
