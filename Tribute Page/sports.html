                <h3>Trebel Winning Moment</h3>
                <p>Manchester United's treble-winning campaign of 1998-99 remains unrivalled in English football. Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary side's achievement is still the benchmark, with the manner in which they clinched the Champions League making for arguably the most dramatic finale of all time.</p>
                <p>The 1998–99 season was Manchester United's seventh season in the FA Premier League and their 24th consecutive season in the top division of English football. After finishing the previous season without winning any titles, United won the Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1998–99, the first and to date only side in English football to do so. During the campaign, United lost only five times: in the Charity Shield against Arsenal; in the fifth round of the League Cup against eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur; and three times in the league, including their only home loss all season, against Middlesbrough in December 1998. </p>

                <h3>2008: Champions of Europe Again</h3>
                <p>Fifty years after the Munich disaster and forty after their first European Cup victory, the 2007-08 Man Utd squad would join the ranks of those teams by defeating Chelsea in the Champions League Final. Supporters that experienced heart trauma during 1999’s dramatic Final found no relief in this one. A feisty first half ended 1-1, a scoreline that would hold until extra time, and eventually, penalties.</p>
                <p>Both sides started two-for-two, but Petr Cech’s save on Ronaldo made Man U’s chances look grim. With Chelsea up 4-3, John Terry would slip and miss his would-be title-clinching shot. Man Utd wouldn’t miss again and a van der Sar save on Nicolas Anelka would win United their third European championship.</p>

                <h3>2013: Going Out On Top</h3>
                <p>Nobody wanted to believe it would, but Alex Ferguson’s final day as boss of Manchester United finally came. Weeks after defeating Aston Villa 3-0 for his 13th title at the club, Sir Alex announced that he was going to retire from managing at the end of the season.</p>
                <p>It didn’t matter much that the result of that final match ended in a 5-5 draw after Man Utd started out with a 3-0 lead, or that the match was being played at The Hawthorns. The man that brought 13 English titles, five FA Cups, two European Championships, and countless other hardware to United received a standing ovation before and after the match in a moment that was surreal to those that watched from all around the world. </p>
